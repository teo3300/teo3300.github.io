## Hey!
Do you remember my [DDR-DancePad](../DDR-DancePad/index.html)?
Well... This is almost the same thing (hopefully more useful)

## What is this "thing"?
So basically (I'm very smol ?[smol nezuko](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1e/34/d1/1e34d1d72583909696bfc2668a488981.png)) this a keyboard for my PC but it's controlled using feet
The objective was to browse music sheets hands-free (You know, I still need my hands to play guitar) so I transformed an Amazon packaging into a pair of electric switches and used an Arduino board to connect them to the computer

## Prototype
Yeah, there is a very poor cable management
Thanks to the construction of the DDR-DancePad I learnt somethig about creating contacts using everything as rigid structure
![Prototype](prototype_inside.jpg)

## Final(?) version
The prototype works fine (for being a heap of cardboards, aluminium foil, copper, hot glue and Geomag). Let's build a decent version!
This new version is made out of wood hinged using tissue (I used velcro hooks) for the rigid parts and foam that act as a spring, the contacts will always be made using aluminium foil (reinforced with paper before gluing them to the wood)
It also has 3 buttons instead of 2 (one of em can act as a modifier key, to have 2 set of 2 buttons instead of 3 different buttons)
![Final](final.jpg)

## The Programm.ino
The thing I love about this project is it's software, it's a really small [program](https://github.com/teo3300/Pedaliera) but it allows me to manage all buttons separetly in a not-so-complex way (like it happens if simply using the "Keyboard" library, I lack fantasy, so I called it "Key")
Every key can be set in  different ways:
 - Simple read (only reads pin status, I used it to switch between the 2 pair of buttons)
 - Combination of buttons (2-5)
 - Toggle (pressing the button change its state)
 - Hold (the button can be long pressed)
 - Press (The button can't be long pressed)

## In conclusion remember: Hot glue is hot
