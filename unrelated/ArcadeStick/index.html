Arcade controller

## Thanks to this site, used for many references:

## Weh?
Following an idea of [a friend of mine](https://twitter.com/Maggio31871196) we decided to build an arcade controller to play games on MAME like on a real arcade machine (it's more like a box that can be attached to a PC to  C O N T R O L - E V E R Y T H I N G)
Never had to deal with someshing that had to be so precise:
 - Buttons and stick specific [layout](https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html)
 - right size for box, holes, plastic and wood panels, screws
 - find a way to keep all components toghether in a sturdy but pretty way, while some of them may have to be replaced or moved in future

## Construction
I don't really know the model of the various internal pieces, just took them as my friend gave them to me, so here's a list of them:
 - 1x SANWA JLF-TP-8YT JOYSTICK
 - 10x Sanwa OBSF-30 Snap In Arcade Button (black and pink) two of them (she "START" and "SELECT") should have been 24mm, but they never arrived R.I.P
 - 1x "[ZERO](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B07BQK88N3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00)" control board
 - 1x [USB-B-Male-to-B-Female cable](https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B002M8VBIS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00)

The main structure is made out of a box of wine bottles (may alcohol always be with us) that was the only piece of wood with an accettable size
The top panel is a 500x240x2mm transparent poliver panel (the size of the box was a bit different but we didn't care)
Making the button holes was a little *BIG* pain in the ass due to their size, the fact that the panel and the box had to be perfectly aligned during the whole process and because every button needs 2 smaller slots at the sides of the hole because of the fixing tabs of the buttons
The controller also has an internal B-type USB port on the back, instead of a USB-cable

## Precision is good, precision is bad
Remember to always use some "junk" material as a training camp, we made 8 out of the 10 button holes on the top plastic panel with an hand drill 'cause the drill press couldn't reach some positions on the panels
Turned out that hand-made holes were a little wider and were more suitable to hold the buttons in place, the buttons in the other 2 holes got stuck and we accidentally cracked the panel while removing them
