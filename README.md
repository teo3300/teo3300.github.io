Wow, a lot of commits!
## I'm finally fine with this version:
  - content of <main> generated from an md-like text
  - theme css separated from the main style.css so esily edit themes
  - responsiveness (meh)
  - working fine on firefox, not so fine with chrome, need to test on opera/edge
  - md-like text support links, titles, images
  - bold and italic not supported (probably bold will never be cause it's used for to highlight hypertext) still function will be very similar to the italic so easy to implement
