Wow, a lot of commits!
## I'm finally fine with this version:
  - content generated from an md-like text
  - theme css detached from the main style.css so easily edit themes
  - responsiveness (not so meh)
  - working fine on firefox, not so fine with chrome, need to test on opera/edge
  - md-like text support links, titles, images, lists
  - bold and italic not supported (probably bold will never be cause it's used to highlight hypertext) still function will be very similar to the italic so easy to implement
  - content blocks and gallery (thumbnails with automatic link to self and description)
  - inline stickers
